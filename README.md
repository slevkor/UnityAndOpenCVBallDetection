# UnityAndOpenCVBallDetection
Hi All.

This project is for GearVR - it uses Unity as the "world" and it uses openCV for ball detection to create a "3D mouse".

You can follow the guide UnityBallRecognitionProject.pdf to create your own project.

Or you can download UnityVRGipProj and \AndroidApp\UnityVRGipProjFinal to see our project.

## A little overview

This project was done as part of our Computer Science BSC degree in the Technion institute. It was made under the [Geometrical Image Processing Lab](http://gip.cs.technion.ac.il/). 

Our main goal was to create a "3D mouse" in Unity Enviorment . In order to do that we had to integrate 

For any questions please send us mail to Levk3112@gmail.com or Noyhess@gmail.com with the Headline "UnityOpenCv Question" and we will be glad to help ( or at lease try :) )
